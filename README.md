A landing page I build to level up my Tailwind CSS & Next.js skills.
The design isn't mine but the code is.

Tech stack:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer motion

The page is fully responsive

Visit the page at https://attorneyster-ta.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
